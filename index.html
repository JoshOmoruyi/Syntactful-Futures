            <h1>A little background about me....</h1>
            <p>I am currently a senior computer science student at my University</p>
            <p>While I can say that my efforts and practices have brought me to a good standing, I can say that the ride was not a smooth one.</p>
            <p>Before college, I was only exposed to computer science one time, yes, one time.</p>
            <p>I was lucky to be able to register for a Mobile Csp Course at my high school my freshman year. This course was my true introduction
                to computer science and inspired me to continue to pursue it as a major. Unfortunately, this course was later removed as the only available professor had other obligations
                that conflicted with our school, and a replacement was never sought out, So just like that, a candle was blown out.</p>
            <p>My first semester as a Compututer Science student was rough. I felt a constant overwelmness and my confidence lacked, while my peers who came from different areas were able to work
                through problems diligently.</p>
                <p>It took me a while to understand and grasp concepts, but after getting the opportunity to get to meet some of my classmates, I came to a realization that my high school couldve better
                    prepared us for STEM majors such as Computer Science.
                </p>
                    <p>Fast forward to 2025, a quick browse of my high school's website informs me that there is now a computer science department listed under STEM.</p>
                    <p>I am glad that local schooling is is finally taking the steps to prepare young students for the next level so they can feel confident, and that is what i intend to
                        do with this.
                    </p>
