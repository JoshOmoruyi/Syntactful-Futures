I always had the interest to share whatever knowledge I am able to collect after I graduate college, and this site gives me a way to convey the importance of technological advances and advice young coding students on how they can improve their coding skills while building their confidence and creativity. I have implements project based learning, advising, as well as interactive quizzes in this website. The name is subject to change ofcourse, and the layout will probably be changed aswell, but the key idea of the site is presented.
